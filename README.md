This Python program is a simple, yet powerful, command-line tool designed to help users create strong and highly secure passwords easily. It focuses on solving the critical problem of weak passwords by allowing users to customize the length (from 8 to 128 characters) and character mix (including symbols, numbers, and both cases of letters). Using the secure secrets module, the generator creates truly random passwords and then uses a math calculation called entropy to instantly grade its strength (e.g., WEAK, STRONG). This gives users the confidence that the unique password they generated is robust enough to protect their valuable digital accounts from unauthorized access.
